VVVV.js is an experimental approach to displaying VVVV patches (or better: the XML code they're base on) within your browser.

While the initial goal was to evaluate the possibilities of <i>displaying VVVV patches</i> on the client side, right now this proof of concept also features basic graph evaluation and a really small set of
common VVVV nodes, ported to Javascript.

Tested with Google Chrome and Firefox 4.
