<p><strong>An open project, which aims to bringing the visual programming language VVVV to your web browser.</strong></p>

<div id="teaser_patch">(Doesnt work)</div>

<p>In case you don't know VVVV already: it's a great piece of software for developing multi media applications using a visual programming language. Click through http://www.vvvv.org to get the details.</p>

<p>While the original VVVV runs as desktop application on Windows, VVVV.js tries to introduce all the great VVVV paradigms to the world of web browsers. In plain language this means:</p>

<p class="box"><em>VVVV.js is a Javascript port of VVVV's "runtime parts", which enables your web browser to run VVVV files (or VVVV XML Code) on the client side.</em></p>

<p>While this sounds just too good to be true, here comes the bummer: besides porting parts of VVVV's internals, all the nodes you want to use have to be ported to Javascript as well. Having in mind, that there are hundreds of nodes for the original VVVV, this is just absurd ... right? But let's just give it a try anyway.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Because once you're into patching VVVV, textual programming just makes you feel fat and sluggish. There should be a way to develope client side web applications the VVVV way.</li>
  <li>Because HTML5 with Canvas and WebGL, combined with powerful Javascript interpreters make it possible.</li>
  <li>Because of a tiny flavour of cross-platform compatibility: VVVV patches on mobile devices, anyone?</li>
</ul>
