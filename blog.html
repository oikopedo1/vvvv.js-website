    Watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56vBXoKhN8Q">preview video on youtube</a> to get an idea of how you will be able
    to <strong>connect VVVV.js to VVVV</strong>, and finally get the runtime-patching experience we love VVVV for.

  <h2>Release: more Canvas with v0.1.2-alpha</h2>
  <div class="blog_meta">Posted: September 16th, 2011</div>
  <p>
    With slight delay we finally reached the next milestone with version 0.1.2-alpha. Besides some changes under the hood (mostly regarding <strong>graph evaluation</strong>), this release introduces a bunch of new nodes,
    covering a major part of <strong>Canvas 2D drawing functionality</strong>.
    As a development guidline we used this handy <a href="http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas_sheet/HTML5_Canvas_Cheat_Sheet.png" target="_new">Canvas HTML5 Cheat Sheet</a>.
  <p>
    Version 0.1.2-alpha allows us to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>draw vector shapes like bezier curves, arcs, rectangles, text</li>
    <li>fill them &mdash; solid or using gradients</li>
    <li>stroke them, using several stroke styles</li>
    <li>draw images and streaming video</li>
    <li>render shadows and glows</li>
    <li>use various blend techniques</li>
    <li>transform all this using regular VVVV transform nodes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/zauner/vvvv.js/blob/v0.1.2-alpha/CHANGELOG" target="_new">CHANGELOG</a>, and check out the <a href="vvvv_js/examples/" target="_new">Examples here</a>, to get the details.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks to <strong>vux, defetto, matise and micro.d</strong> for contributing to this release! The next big step is tackling the WebGL pipeline, by implementing dynamic shaders, render state nodes, etc. If you're interested
  in participating here, contact us via Github!</p>
  
  <p>Also, we set up a very basic out-of-the-box <a href="/forum" target="_new">Forum</a>, to provide you with a place for questions and suggestions. It's brandnew, so don't be shy!</p>

  <h2>VVVV.js' road to 1.0</h2>
  <div class="blog_meta">Posted: August 16th, 2011</div>
  <p>
    Many of you might wonder how this VVVV.js thing is going to evolve, and when it will be actually usable, if at all. So probably it's time to create a rough plan with
    <b>some milestones</b>, that have to be accomplished.
  <p>
  <p>
    Of course, the roadmap below is not carved in stone at all. Rather, it's an overview of the things that have to be tackled, and of when this might happen.
  </p>
  <img src="vvvvjsroadmap.png"/>
  <p>
    As you can see, we're first heading for some visual bragging to find out, what's possible in terms of <b>Canvas 2D and WebGL 3D graphics</b> <span style="text-decoration:line-through">(In fact, the set of Canvas drawing
    nodes will be released this week)</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    After this, we will deal with ways to connect VVVV to the browser, to simplify the development process, and create the <b>VVVV-typical patch-while-running experience</b>. Simultaneiously,
    lots of the many utility nodes should be ported at this stage, beginning with String and Value nodes, to pave the way for some data visualization demos.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other steps include handling <b>subpatches</b>, getting rid of <b>VVVViewer glitches</b> and of course <b>performance optimization</b>.
  <p>
    As you can see, there's a bunch of work to do, and we could really use some help. If you're interested in any particular component, <b>get in touch with us!</b>
